## Not so good astronaut data analysis code

This repository contains a helper software project with some code to be used 
for the [FAIR research software course](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-research-software). 

This repository is an example of "not so good" software that is meant to be improved over the course to show examples of better 
and more FAIR software practices. 

### What the code does
The code uses the [NASA data on human space walks (Extravehicular activities - EVAs)](https://data.nasa.gov/Raw-Data/Extra-vehicular-Activity-EVA-US-and-Russia/9kcy-zwvn/data_preview), 
exported/downloaded in JSON format, does some analysis over this data, plots a few graphs and saves the data in CSV format. 

### Things to improve
There is a number of things that are wrong or not so good with this code and that can be improved. We maintain that list at issue
https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/astronout-data-analyses-bad/issues/2.

### Better code
An example of better and more FAIR code that participants should strive to achieve when writing their reseach software 
can be found at the [astronout-data-analysis-fair repository](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/astronout-data-analysis-fair), 
to be used in conjuction with this repository during the course.
